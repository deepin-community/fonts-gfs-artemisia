Description: Greek font (Times Greek-like)
 The type family GFS Artemisia was designed by the painter-engraver
 Takis Katsoulidis and reflects his style and typographic acumen. It
 is largely his effort to offer, from a different perspective, a type
 face which, like Times Greek, would be applicable to a wide spectrum
 of uses and equally agreeable and legible. The typeface has been
 digitised by George D. Matthiopoulos.
